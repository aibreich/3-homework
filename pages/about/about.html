            <h3>Just some dudes being guys.</h3>
            <p>We build stuff, race stuff, break stuff, fix stuff, and then put that stuff on YouTube. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>
            <p>People like you have supported us through buying merch, and that allows us to keep doing what we're doing. So we give back in the form of badass cars, and that shit changes people's lives.
            </p>
            <p>All in all, it's mostly a load of shenanigans amongst our group of friends...Just a bunch of car guys trying to go faster and faster, and have a damn good time doing it.</p>

            <h3>Giving People Cars
            </h3>
            <p>We started giving away manual cars a few years ago to some of our supporters, through a series of "Save The Manuals" giveaways. We wanted to give other people the chance to experience what high performance cars feel like--a chance some people may never get.</p>
            <p>After recent events, we realized that modified cars, and even the ability to modify YOUR OWN CAR, are in danger thanks to new, tighter restrictions being enforced by the EPA-doesn't matter if you want to turn your personal property into a drag monster that's built only for the track. Ridiculous right? We agree.</p>
            <p>A few organizations and other creators on the internet are trying to do something about it, by pushing and promoting the RPM Act.</p>
            <p>What is the RPM Act? Well, from SEMA: "The RPM Act of 2021 (H.R. 3281), is common-sense, bi-partisan legislation to protect Americans' right to convert street vehicles into dedicated racecars and the motorsports-parts industry's ability to sell products that enable racers to compete."</p>
            <p>We stand for this, and we want to do our part. Aside from promoting this on YouTube, we're shifting the direction and goal of our giveaways. Manual cars may be an endangered species, but now things are getting a little more serious--ALL RACECARS now have a target on their back. If we're going to get people's attention from what we're doing, we want them to be aware of what's going on, and what they can do about it.
